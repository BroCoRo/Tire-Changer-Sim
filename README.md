This simulation uses Unity's HDRP to create an interactive 3D environment to practice the steps of changing a tire.

The simulation uses imported 3D models to enhance the simulation.

The program processes, menus, inventory, camera angles, and interactivity were set up by our team consisting of:
- Brodin Collins-Robb
- Blake Hadaway 
- Hayden Auterhoff
- Talon Ernst
- Jordan O'Neill
